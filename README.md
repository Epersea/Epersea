# A bit about me

I have a background in Advertising and English to Spanish translation, an industry where I have freelanced successfully for the best part of a decade. In 2021, I decided to try a programming course ‚Äújust to see what it‚Äôs all about‚Äù. What I discovered was a big passion for all things coding that I'm now making into my career.

After two years of coding consistently, I have completed several certifications, including CS50, Harvard‚Äôs introduction to Computer Science, where I received stellar grades, and a web-oriented coding bootcamp at Devscola, a coding school based in Valencia.

I have applied my learnings to develop a personal project, Freelancer Helper, a web application using Flask and SQL which aims to help freelancers to get organized and earn more while working less. Please feel free to check my repo for the in-progress version 2.0 of this project, with an emphasis on good practices and a different tech stack (Node.js and Express). 

Up to this point, I have absolutely loved my coding journey and I‚Äôm looking forward to keep learning and be challenged!
