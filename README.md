# Hello world! üëã

My name is Elisa Fern√°ndez and I'm a **backend software developer** based in Madrid. I have close to a year of experience working as a backend developer at a startup with a strong focus on TDD, Extreme Programming, Agile and best practices, using **Ruby** as my main language. 

I'm currently looking for new job opportunities focused on **Ruby on Rails**, which I learned by developing [this personal project](https://github.com/Epersea/freelancer_helper_rails), a web application that helps freelancers get organized by knowing their desired rates and creating project and client registries.

Besides Ruby/Rails, I also have some experience in JavaScript/Node, Python/Flask and SQL, and of course I'm always open to learning new stacks and technologies.

# A bit about me

I‚Äôm not your typical junior developer, since **I transitioned into programming after a decade-long, successful career as a freelance translator**. This experience has help me hone many useful soft skills, such as self-learning, communication, proactivity and task management.

In 2021 I tried a coding course ‚Äújust to see what this is all about‚Äù ‚Äìand as a passionate problem solver and a very logic-oriented person, it was love at first sight. After several years of coding consistently, I have completed several **certifications**, including CS50, HarvardX‚Äôs introduction to Computer Science, where I received great grades, and an online web-oriented coding bootcamp. 

**I care deeply about...**
- Best practices. Knowing that code could not only be functional but **beautiful** was a revelation for me. I like things clean, ordered and step-by-step, and I try to reflect that in my code to the best of my ability. I always try to plan ahead and clarify requirements, and I really like to explore different ways of **testing** my code to ensure its reliability.
- Continuous **learning**. Programming is a career I chose out of passion, because I wanted a field where I could always be learning and improving. 
- Developing my knowledge of **programming fundamentals**. Over the last few months I have been focusing on technical books about OOP, data structures and algorithms. I'm currently focused on design patterns, and refactoring is next on my list.

Up to this point, I have absolutely loved my coding journey and I‚Äôm looking forward to keep being challenged!
