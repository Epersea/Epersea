# Hello world! üëã

My name is Elisa Fern√°ndez and I'm a **Ruby on Rails product developer** based in Madrid. I have close to two years of experience working in small product companies, where I have had the opportunity to wear many hats and develop my coding, communication and product skills.  

I'm currently working as a Product Engineer with **Ruby on Rails** at SportsKey, an Irish company dedicated to helping the world play more sport with its software. I learned RoR by developing [this personal project](https://github.com/Epersea/freelancer_helper_rails), a web application that helps freelancers get organized by knowing their desired rates and creating project and client registries.

Besides Ruby/Rails, I also have some experience in JavaScript/Node, Python/Flask and SQL, and of course I'm always open to learning new stacks and technologies.

# A bit about me

I‚Äôm not your typical software developer, since **I transitioned into programming after a decade-long, successful career as a freelance translator**. This experience has helped me hone many useful soft skills, such as self-learning, communication, proactivity and task management.

In 2021, I tried a coding course ‚Äújust to see what this is all about‚Äù ‚Äìand as a passionate problem solver and a very logic-oriented person, it was love at first sight. After several years of coding consistently, I have completed several **certifications**, including CS50, HarvardX‚Äôs introduction to Computer Science, where I received great grades, and an online web-oriented coding bootcamp. 

**I care deeply about...**
- **Bringing the best possible product to our users**. Working in small companies has allowed me to have an active role in the product definition process, helping shape the requirements and suggesting changes to improve the user experience. I always try to look at our product with curiosity and put myself in the users' shoes.
- **Best practices**. Knowing that code could not only be functional but beautiful was a revelation for me. I like things clean, ordered and step-by-step, and I try to reflect that in my code to the best of my ability. I really like to explore different ways of testing my code to ensure its reliability.
- **Continuous learning**. Programming is a career I chose out of passion, because I wanted a field where I could always be learning and improving. My reading list includes technical books about OOP, data structures, design patterns and algorithms, as well as product development.

Up to this point, I have absolutely loved my coding journey and I‚Äôm looking forward to continuing to be challenged!
